# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO Tic-Tac-Toe

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO Python Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played by two human players.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO For my final project I will build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game. It is going to have the same aspect and rule set as the orginal Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will be conducted to be played human vs human that can be ran unlimited times.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO Implement a Tic-Tac-Toe board, where the players will be able to choose where they would like to put their pieces. The game will also be able to select the winner once a player has three in a row.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO Allowing the user interaction to select and place piece in the spot of their choice.
Select the correct winner once the pieces are in a row wheater Vertically or horizontally
Seledt No winner when no one has won the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO Make a game that actually works.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO Research pygame
setup working environment
build Tic-tac-toe board
Add both game pieces (X's And O's)
